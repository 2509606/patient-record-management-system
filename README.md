## Features

- **User Authentication** - Secure login and signup with hashed passwords, role-based access
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Admin, Doctor, Nurse, and Patient roles with granular permissions
- **Patient Record CRUD** - Create, read, update, and archive patient records (MongoDB)
- **Appointments** - Book and manage appointments between patients and doctors
- **Prescriptions** - Create and view prescriptions linked to patients
- **Emergency Contacts** - Patients can manage their own emergency contacts
- **Payments** - Checkout, receipts, and payment history for patients
- **Medical File Uploads** - Upload and manage medical documents and images per patient
- **Admin Panel** - User management, account approvals, audit log, and login history
- **Audit Logging** - All patient actions are logged for accountability
- **CSRF Protection** - All forms protected against cross-site request forgery
- **Search and Pagination** - Dynamic search with input delay and paginated record lists
- **Database Interconnection** - Patient records in MongoDB reference user IDs from SQLite

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python) with app factory pattern
- **User Database:** SQLite (authentication and user management)
- **Patient Database:** MongoDB (patient records, appointments, prescriptions, audit logs)
- **Frontend:** HTML templates with Jinja2, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Containerisation:** Docker Compose (for MongoDB)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd patient-record-management-system
   ```

2. Start MongoDB using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Copy the environment file and configure:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## User Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Admin** | Register users, manage users, approve accounts, view audit log, view login history, archive/restore patients, view/edit patients |
| **Doctor** | Add patients, view/edit patients, book appointments, create prescriptions, upload/delete medical files |
| **Nurse** | View patients, view appointments, view prescriptions, view medical files |
| **Patient** | View own appointments, view own prescriptions, manage emergency contacts, make payments, view payment history |

## Database Interconnection

The system uses two databases that work together:

- **SQLite** stores user accounts (id, username, hashed password, role, approval status)
- **MongoDB** stores patient records, appointments, prescriptions, emergency contacts, payments, medical files, and audit logs — each referencing the SQLite user ID via `created_by` or similar fields

This means every record is linked to the user who created it, connecting the two databases.
